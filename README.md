# 🌌 Nova AI – The Desktop Assistant That Doesn’t Sleep (Even If The Team Did)

Nova AI is your personal all-in-one AI-powered desktop assistant, capable of real-time voice interaction, intelligent responses, and even generating images from thin air (okay, text prompts, but close enough).

Designed by **Avinandan Mukherjee** and **Bijan Mandal**, first-year students who didn’t know when to quit, this project brings voice tech, AI, and GUI together—because why not start chaotic?

## ⚡ What Nova Can Do

- 🎤 **Talk to You in Real-Time**  
  Voice commands? Nova’s listening. (Mic permitting… RIP debugging.)

- 🖼️ **Generate Images Using AI**  
  Just give it a prompt, and watch it create visuals out of words.

- 🔊 **Reads Out Loud Like Your Cool AI Friend**  
  Uses TTS engines to make replies feel alive.

- 🧠 **Built with APIs from Groq, Cohere, Hugging Face, and More**  
  He's smart. Smarter than most of us at 3 AM.
