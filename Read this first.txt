✨ NOVA AI - README ✨
=========================

Made with rage, late nights, and too much caffeine by:
👉 Bijan & Avinandan 💻🔥

 How to Run:

1. First, run the **install_req.bat** file.
   - This will install all the necessary dependencies.
   - Just let it finish. It won’t bite (probably).

2. Once it's done, run the **Nova AI** file.
   - Sit back, relax, and prepare to be mildly impressed.

---

⚠️ Important Notes:
- Don't delete any files unless you enjoy breaking things.
- If something crashes, blame the system. Not us.
- Works best on systems that aren't from the stone age.

🧠 Enjoy using Nova AI, and remember:
    Real devs use dark mode 😎
